You wake up in a bed of a dimly lit room. You don't remember how you got here. A quick peek through the windows behind you indicate that you are inside of an apartment building, on a high up floor. It's dark outside and you can't see much of anything.

Looks like you're in a bedroom. You see two large cupboards - one against the wall to your left and one on the opposite wall, which also houses a TV. There's a door on the far end of the left wall.
